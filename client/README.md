📖 How the App Works
The Cost Splitter App is a lightweight and intuitive tool that helps users split expenses fairly among a group of people. It’s perfect for roommates, travel groups, friends dining out, or any situation where costs need to be shared.

🧑‍💼 1. User Registration
Users can create an account with their email and password.

This ensures a personalized experience and allows data persistence across sessions.

Proper feedback is shown if the email is already registered.

🔐 2. Login
Users can log in securely using their credentials.

On success, they're taken to the home page where they can begin entering shared expenses.

Clear messages are shown for wrong passwords or missing accounts.

🚪 3. Continue Without Logging In (Optional)
For users who want to try the app quickly, there’s a “Continue without Logging In” button.

They’re taken to a temporary session to split costs without saving any data.

🧾 4. Splitting Costs
Users can:

Enter the total amount of the expense.

Specify the number of people sharing the expense.

Instantly see how much each person owes.

The calculation is automatic and updates in real time.

📋 5. Expense Summary
The app displays:

The total bill

Number of people

The amount each individual should pay

This keeps everything transparent and avoids arguments.

📱 6. Mobile-Friendly Design
The UI is clean and responsive.

Works well on phones, tablets, and desktops for flexibility on the go.
